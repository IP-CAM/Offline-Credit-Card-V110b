Offline-Credit-Card-V110 (Revised)
=========================
My work were using Opencart for an E commerce site when we came across a flaw in one of the plugins, so I slightly changed the plugin as the original did not capture the start date and some cards <em>(in UK anyway)</em> need that feature. 

I did not write the origional, but it is freely available via the Opencart website under the same name.
