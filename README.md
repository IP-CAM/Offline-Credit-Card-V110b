Offline-Credit-Card-V110 (Revised)
=========================
My work were using Opencart for an E commerce site when we came across a flaw in one of the plugins, so I slightly changed the plugin as the original did not capture the start date and some cards <em>(in UK anyway)</em> need that feature. 

I did not write the origional, but it is freely available via the Opencart website under the same name.

##Install##
If you already have this installed then you should remove and uninstall the origional files if possible. Although no actual database information was changed or altered so a replacement of origional files should be possible. 

<STRONG>BACKUP YOUR FILES BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT AN INSTALL</STRONG>

Upload like any other plugin and it should just run as you would expect.
